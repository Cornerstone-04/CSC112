# Assignments

## Assignment 1

- Develop a c++ program that computes the total payment for purchases made by a customer given the following discount amount based on the following purchases.

- If amount is b/w 200k and 1m, discount = 3%.

- If amount is above 1m, discount = 7%.

## Assignment 2

- Modify assignment 1 in such a way that the user can use it for as many customers as possible without shutting down the program.

## Exercise 1

- Write a function that determines the number of days in February, given that only leap years have 29 days in Feb, otherwise it's 28 days.

## Exercise 2

- Write a function that changes a 24-hour time format to a 12-hour format.
