Sure, here are 5 C++ questions related to date and time manipulations:

1. **Days in a Month**:  
Write a C++ function that accepts a year and a month (represented as an integer from 1 to 12) and returns the number of days in that month. Remember that some months have 30 days, some have 31, and February varies based on whether it's a leap year or not.

2. **Weekday of January 1st**:  
Given a year, write a C++ function that determines the day of the week for January 1st of that year. Assume that January 1, 1900 was a Monday and use the provided rules for leap years to calculate the weekday.

3. **Last Day of a Month**:  
Create a C++ function that, given a year and month, returns the name of the weekday (e.g., "Monday", "Tuesday", etc.) for the last day of that month.

4. **Date Difference**:  
Write a C++ function that determines the difference in days between two given dates (without using any built-in date libraries). You should define a struct for the date, with day, month, and year as members, and the function should accept two such structs as input.

5. **Add Days to Date**:  
Design a C++ function that adds a given number of days to a date and returns the resulting date. Ensure the function correctly accounts for months of varying lengths and leap years.

Note: Implementing solutions for these questions requires careful consideration of leap years and the varying number of days in different months.
